# The exercises in this part of the course have no automated tests, as the results as visually verified.
# The tests grant points automatically as you submit your solution to the server, no matter what your implementation.
# Only submit your solution when you are ready, and your solution matches the exercise description.
# The exercises may not have automatic tests, but the course staff will still see your solution.
# If your solution clearly does not match the exercise description, you may lose the points granted for the exercises in this part.
